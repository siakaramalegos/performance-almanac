## Voting application

The app was created by [Lea Verou](https://github.com/LeaVerou) and used for the 2020 Web Almanac CSS chapter. It's built on a tool called [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) which asks for access to your repos to log in. You do not have to log in. You can use the links on the voting page to navigate to an issue and add a üëç to the first comment in the issue. This is how the votes are tallied.
