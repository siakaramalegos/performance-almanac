# 2021 Web Almanac Performance Chapter - stat/content planning

[Vote](https://projects.verou.me/mavoice/?repo=siakaramalegos/performance-almanac&labels=proposed%20stat) for the stats you most want to see covered in the 2021 chapter on performance. Don't see one you like? Propose a new one with a new issue, and label it "proposed stat". Be clear about the specific data. Feel free to comment on issues with caveats, questions, etc.

To better understand what data is available, check out the 2020 chapter on [Methodology](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/methodology). Generally speaking, we have access to HTTPArchive, CrUX, and Lighthouse data for about 7.5 million websites.
